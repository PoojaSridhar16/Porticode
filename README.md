# Hackman Porticode 



This is what it does:
* It's a game
* First part is a riddle game - user inputs one word answers
* Second part is a hangman game - user inputs one letter answers to guess a word


Stuff left to do:
- [ ] Add a maze for the first section
- [ ] Try and develop own code, so we don't need to use external files.
